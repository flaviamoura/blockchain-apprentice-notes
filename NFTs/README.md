# NFTs notes

## What is an NFT?

NFT (Non-Fungible Token) is a unique and non-replicable type of digital asset registered on a blockchain. While cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are fungible, meaning each unit is the same and interchangeable, NFTs are unique and cannot be directly exchanged for other assets. They can represent anything digitally verifiable, such as artwork, music, videos, games, tweets, and even memes.

Each NFT has a unique record on its blockchain that contains detailed information about its ownership and transaction history, which allows authentication and verification of its authenticity.

## What are NFTs used for?

- **Art:** NFTs can be used to represent unique digital art pieces that are authenticated on a blockchain.
- **Gaming:** NFTs can be used to represent in-game assets or virtual real estate, allowing gamers to buy, sell, and trade unique virtual items.
- **Collectibles:** NFTs can be used to represent digital collectibles, such as trading cards, limited edition items, and other unique digital assets.
- **Domain names:** NFTs can be used to represent ownership of domain names, providing a secure and verifiable way for domain owners to transfer ownership of their domain names.
- **Ticketing and membership:**  NFTs can be used to represent ownership or membership of a particular event or organization. Ticketing NFTs provide a secure and verifiable way to transfer ownership of event tickets, while membership NFTs provide access to exclusive features or content within a community or organization. 
- **Music:** NFTs can be used to represent music tracks or albums, providing a secure and authenticated way for artists to sell their music.

## How to buy an NFT?
To buy NFTs, you'll need a digital wallet, purchase cryptocurrency, and find a marketplace to browse and buy NFTs. Once you've found an NFT you want to buy, you can bid or buy it outright with cryptocurrency from your wallet. The NFT will then be transferred to your digital wallet. A few of the most popular wallets include:

- ✅ MetaMask 
- ✅ Trust Wallet 
- ✅ Coinbase Wallet 
- ✅ MyEtherWallet

## How to sell an NFT?

To sell an NFT, you need to choose a marketplace that allows NFT sales. Once you have chosen the platform, create a listing for your NFT by providing a description, images, and pricing. After a buyer purchases your NFT, transfer the ownership to their digital wallet in exchange for payment.
Most famous marketplaces for selling NFTs include:
- ✅ OpenSea
- ✅ Rarible
- ✅ Nifty Gateway
- ✅ SuperRare

## Are NFTs secure?

NFTs are generally considered secure as they are built on blockchain technology, which is designed to be tamper-proof and resistant to hacks or attacks. However, the security of NFTs also depends on the security of the digital wallets used to store and manage them. 
 
**Precautions:**

- Use reputable wallets and marketplaces
- Keep your private keys and login information safe and secure. 
- Verify the authenticity of the NFT and the reputation of the seller before making a purchase, as there have been cases of fraud and scams in the NFT space.
- Check if the value of the NFT is fair and reasonable compared to other similar NFTs on the market. Also consider factors such as rarity, history, and popularity of the NFT.
