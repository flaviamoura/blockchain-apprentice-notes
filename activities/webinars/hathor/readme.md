### What is Hathor Network?
The Hathor Network is a decentralized blockchain platform that aims to provide a scalable, secure, and user-friendly infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps) and digital tokens. It was launched in 2020 with the goal of overcoming some of the limitations faced by other blockchain networks, such as scalability, security, and mass adoption.

The Hathor Network utilizes a combination of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) and a blockchain to offer a scalable solution. The DAG allows for multiple transactions to be processed simultaneously, thereby increasing the number of transactions per second that the network can handle. Additionally, the Hathor Network implements a consensus mechanism called "Proof of Work Time," which combines elements of both Proof of Work and Proof of Stake to ensure the security and decentralization of the network.

### Key features

The Hathor Network has several key features that set it apart as a unique blockchain platform. Here are some of the main features of the Hathor Network:

- **Scalability**
- **User-Friendliness** 
- **Hybrid Consensus**
- **Integration with Other Blockchains**
- **Smart Contracts**
  
### Security

Security is a priority in the Hathor Network. In addition to using the "Proof of Work Time" consensus mechanism to ensure network security, the Hathor Network also implements additional measures such as 51% attack detection and double-spending prevention to protect users' digital assets and transactions.

### Overview

The Hathor Network aims to promote interoperability and integration with other blockchains, enabling the transfer of assets and collaboration between different networks. Additionally, the platform is working on developing a programming language for smart contracts, which will open up new possibilities for the creation of more complex and automated decentralized applications.

Overall, the Hathor Network aspires to become a reliable and scalable infrastructure for the development and deployment of decentralized applications, facilitating the adoption of blockchain technology across various industries and driving innovation on a large scale.
