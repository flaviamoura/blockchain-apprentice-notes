# Webinar Cloud Dev

### Domain 1 - Cloud Concepts

#### What is Cloud?
This is the allocation of web services through the internet where you only pay for what you use. Also known as "pay-as-you-go pricing" by AWS.

#####Benefits:

- **Fast scalability** both horizontally and vertically;
- AWS offers a usage-based payment model, allowing for a **low initial investment**;
- **High availability** ensures service continuity and minimizes downtime by preventing failures;
- **Geographic flexibility**, with AWS you can deploy your applications and services in any geographic region around the world, reducing end-user latency.
  
#### What is the AWS infrastructure like?

The AWS infrastructure is organized into **regions**, which are geographic locations where AWS operates multiple data centers. Each region is divided into **availability zones (AZ)**, which are physically separate and isolated data centers that are connected with low latency links.  

#### Application deployment models or types:

- **Cloud:** applications and services are deployed and run entirely on cloud infrastructure, such as that provided by AWS;
- **On-premises:** applications and services are deployed and run entirely on infrastructure located within an organization's own data centers or facilities;
- **Hybrid:** applications and services are deployed and run on a combination of both cloud and on-premises infrastructure, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of both models. 

#### Cloud services usage models:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) 
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Software as a Service (SaaS)

### Domain 2 - Security and Compliance

#### Shared responsibility:

- AWS - of the cloud;
- You - in the cloud.
