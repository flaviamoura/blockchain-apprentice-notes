# API Project
This REST API is used for querying, creating, updating, and deleting clients and cities, utilizing the MySQL database!

## Initial Setup:
Before running the code, you need to import the following packages:
```
npm install 
```

### Database:
Create a MySQL database and update the database name and password in the file [database]()!
```js
const database = new Sequelize('nomeDoBD', 'root', 'senha', {
    host: 'localhost',
    dialect: 'mysql'
});
```
After configuring the database, navigate to the src folder in the terminal and enter the following command:
```
node app
```
Now the API should be up and running. Use Postman to execute the following endpoints! ðŸ˜„ðŸŽ‰
Make sure to select "raw" in the Body section of Postman and switch to JSON format!
